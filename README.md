# Emaily
This is a website that allows people to send out surveys and collect response. It is implemented using node.js and react.
The project is based on the course project from [Here](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/learn/v4/overview)
I am continuing adding features as practice. I added facebook login, survey deletion, and some UI improvements.
